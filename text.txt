I'm Harshit Kamriya , a Data Scientist enthusiast and web explorer
                I specialize in Java,Python and libraries of python used in AI and ML,
                I Love problem solving and I belive great engineering starts with curiosity
                and ends with clarity.I belive that "celebrating small wins matters" in long run
                when your dreams are to big. I bring percision and performance to
                every code

Projects
Coders of Delhi
In this project I worked of data-cleaning , data-preprocessing and
                        features like people you may know , the books you may like and many more.
                        This project is puerly built on python , no python libraries are used.



Iris flower detection



                        In this project I worked on iris data set , In which the data of flower is given like sepal
                        length,sepan width , petal length , petal width and
                        I used streamlit frame work to deploy this model , In this model 80% data I used for training
                        and 20% used for testing
                        you can easily view the predict the flower with changing the all four things


Gurgaoon Real State

In this project I worked of california house data of 1990s , to predict the house value
                        acording to the location and many more factore, In this libraries like numpy,pandas ,
                        siketlearn, joblib and many more are used
                        and to predict the most accurate house value random forest model is used , as I tested it and
                        among all the models available it has given
                        the best accuracy result.
